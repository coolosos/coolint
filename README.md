An opinionated and strict set of lint rules for Dart and Flutter projects to enforce a clean, robust, and consistent codebase.

---

## Why coolint?

The Dart ecosystem provides a solid foundation for linting with `package:lints`. `coolint` builds on top of the recommended set of rules from `package:lints` and adds many more carefully selected rules to:

-   **Prevent Common Errors**: A wide range of rules to catch potential runtime errors during static analysis.
-   **Enforce a Consistent Style**: Keep your codebase looking clean and uniform, no matter how many developers are working on it.
-   **Promote Best Practices**: Encourage the use of modern and performant Dart features.
-   **Improve Readability**: A well-linted codebase is easier to read, understand, and maintain.

## Getting Started

### 1. Add dependency

Add `coolint` to your `pubspec.yaml` file under `dev_dependencies`.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  coolint: ^2.1.1 # Make sure to use the latest version
```

### 2. Configure analysis_options.yaml

`coolint` provides two sets of rules: one for pure Dart projects and one for Flutter projects.

#### For Flutter Projects

Include the Flutter ruleset in your `analysis_options.yaml` file. This includes all the Dart and Flutter specific rules.

```yaml
include: package:coolint/flutter.yaml
```

*Note: For backward compatibility, you can also use `include: package:coolint/coolint.yaml`, which is the same as `flutter.yaml`.*

#### For Pure Dart Projects

If you are working on a pure Dart project (e.g., a command-line tool or a server-side application), you can use the Dart-only ruleset.

```yaml
include: package:coolint/dart.yaml
```

That's it! The Dart analyzer will now use the selected rules from `coolint`.

## Philosophy

The philosophy of `coolint` is to be **strict but pragmatic**. The rules are designed to be strict enough to prevent common pitfalls and ensure high code quality, but not so strict that they become a burden or hinder productivity.

This package is ideal for teams and individuals who want to maintain a high standard of quality in their Dart and Flutter projects.
